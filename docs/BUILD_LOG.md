## 2026-07-16 — Kickoff + Phase 0

**Done:**
- Settled the founding decisions (D-001…D-005 in DECISIONS.md): all three feed formats in Phase 1; portfolios seeded from SEC 13F filings; Quarkus + jOOQ for serving; a small real reference-data slice; serving on real AWS provisioned by Terraform.
- Cloud accounts set up: AWS and Databricks Free Edition.
- Phase 0 scaffolding: monorepo layout (`ingest/ spark/ reference/ serving/ alts-hitl/ infra/ docs/`), `infra/docker-compose.yml` (Postgres 16, volume-backed, healthcheck, loopback-only port binding), `Makefile` (`up/down/psql/logs/status/clean/help`), `.env.example` + `.gitignore`, README with architecture diagram and phase table, the four docs/ files, `git init`.
- Verified: `make up` brings Postgres 16 to healthy; `psql` connects and answers queries.

- Published to GitHub. Engineering conventions adopted from here on: feature branches merged via PRs (no direct commits to main), tests with every component, CI (lint + tests) arriving with the first code in Phase 1.

**Notes:**
- The compose file publishes Postgres on `127.0.0.1` only — a dev database with default credentials should not be reachable from any network, whatever the host firewall allows.
- `make down` keeps the data volume; only `make clean` deletes it. The stop-working / destroy-state distinction is deliberate.
